## Who am I?

My name is Brandon Tat (he/him/his) and I am currently living in the bay area.
I graduated in 2022 from Cal Poly SLO with a B.S in computer science.

## What am I currently doing?

I am currently working at VMware as a software engineer. Most of my work is
done in Go.

I like to spend time tinkering with my vim set-up. I was using
[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) + [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux). But
I've switched over to my own neovim set-up which I wrote using
[kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/bjtat/kickstart.nvim).
