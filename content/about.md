## Who am I?

My name is Brandon Tat (he/him/his) and I am currently residing in the bay area. I recently graduated in 2022 from Cal Poly SLO with a B.S in computer science.

During my time in college, I thought I wanted to become a professor, hence I did some research during my time in undergrad. Most of my research was spent in data science and I even did a research fellowship with the Central Coast Data Science fellowship.

However, I realized that my interest lies more in the domain of engineering and less in research. I found that out after doing my second internship. I also realized that I was more interested in distributed systems, operating systems, and general software engineering.

## What am I currently doing?

I am currently working full-time at VMware as a software engineer. Most of my work is done in Go, which is a language I find fascinating. It reminds me of C, if C was written in the modern day with a hint of Python.

## What do I enjoy?

When I'm alone, I like to spend time tinkering with my vim set-up. I am currently using [lunarvim](lunarvim.org/) + [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) as my personal programming set-up.

I am also trying to pick up competitive programming but I am still at the stage of just getting through Leetcode problems comfortably in Go. Despite Go not having a robust data structure library, I am trying to get through a majority of the popular Leetcode problems with it to hone my skills with the language.

I also enjoy tennis, basketball, reading, and videogames.
