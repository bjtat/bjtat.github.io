### Why did I make this website?

Great question honestly.
I was not sure what to do during my PTO.
I had a feeling that I wanted to do something that allowed me to practice my craft.
I had an old web-app that functioned as my personal website but only had the functionality as my resume.
I've wanted to start writing for fun for a while but never got to it.
My original plan was to use medium or notion, but that was too boring and easy.
Hence, I created this website using Hugo deployed on GitHub Pages.
It's set up with GitHub Actions which allows me to make a commit and automatically build and deploy the website.

### What do I plan to put here?

Another great question, I have no idea as of right now.

Here is a list of things I want to do:
- Book notes/reviews
- Notes from classes or subjects I'm studying
- Project write-ups
- My random opinions in events or subjects in tech
