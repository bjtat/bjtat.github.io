### Why did I make this website?

I was not sure what to do during my PTO and I was bored. I had an old web-app
that was suppose to be my personal website but only had the functionality of a
resume. I've wanted to start writing for fun for a while but never got to it.
My original plan was to use Medium or Notion, but I really wanted to be able to
edit the site in my terminal. So, I created this website using Hugo deployed on
GitHub Pages. It's set up with GitHub Actions which allows me to make a commit
and automatically build and deploy the website.

### What do I plan to put here?

Here is a list of things I want to do:
- Book notes/reviews
- Notes from classes or subjects I'm studying
- Project write-ups

I'm not sure how much of this I'll actually do but it's worth a try.
